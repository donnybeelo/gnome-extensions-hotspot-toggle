To install manually, clone the repo, `cd` into the directory and run `make install`.

2. In the Automate app, set the bluetooth device to your machine
3. Start the flow
4. In the settings window of the extension, enter the Bluetooth MAC address of your Android device and the SSID of your device's hotspot.
